Take the time to rest and prepare yourself. Be assured that dynamic and creative changes are in motion. In business, you may find that activity is slow and that it is not a good time to commit yourself to long-term plans.")

But how can you know who are your right friends and mentors? Like the ideal mother, you too must develop unconditional love--a love that is beyond emotional entanglement.
