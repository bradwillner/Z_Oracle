In business, you may find that activity is slow and that it is not a good time to commit yourself to long-term plans.")

The inner peace and independence represented by the Heaven trigram is undermined by the heaviness of Water.")
	print ("Where such divergence of nature or ideas occurs, situations may rapidly turn udly--unless we remain clearheaded and ready to meet opponents halfway. Rather than personally pushing matters to the limit (even though we may have justifiable cause), it is wise to seek arbitraition from an impartial, experienced mediator.")

Lu advises us to behave with decorum, diplomacy, and good humor, safe in the knowledge that these may pacify even the most irritating of individuals.
